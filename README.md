# Project Overview

Does anyone remember NetScape? It was the pre-dawn of what is now Mozilla FireFox - an open source browser built for those who like a open, secure world wide web. Sometime ago they decided to offer a way to run FireFox with .NET instead of the over hydrated full fledged browser we know as FireFox - this simmered down project was named GeckoFX and was supported for many years. Unfortunately a drawback is that it is now just as old as .NET itself and its not a pretty or fast solution for browsing needs. So in general this project will take some modern approaches to the very old simmered down GeckoFX and turn it into a concept. This is not intended for production for now at least.
