# Security Policy
Welcome to the security policy of this project

Currently – the project is in development – previously I had this project under another name – and converted it to a second name before shutting down development. 
This was mainly due to the complexity of the project and well, we have so many browsers as it is. 
However I decided to relaunch the project with a whole new set of approaches that may make it successful or just a really good concept I am not sure of either yet. 

One of the big parts of this project is going to be writing the updates to the Engine itself to make it work with .NET – currently you could use CefSharp but, the big issues with it right now is its designed to just add an embedded webbrowser not *be* a webbrowser. 

The re-write or updates to the engine will be forked from an existing engine/wrapper and modified in that native language – whether it is C++ or C# just depending on the route that is taken. (TBD) 

With the custom rewrite, and separation of the engine itself security vulnerabilities should be reported in that (TBD) GitHub repository. 

# Supported Versions
Unless otherwise specified Version support will be for the current and one-step previous for example V0.1 and V0.1.1 will be supported until V0.1.2 at which point V0.1 will be unsupported. For security reasons we will not discuss in too much detail security fixes – however – critical fixes or ones that are very important – the previous versions will be immediately discontinued and no longer supported. 

Keep your install of the project constantly up to date the best you can (auto-updates are coming) and if you are using the source code please remember to update it also. 

Current Version: V0 Unreleased
